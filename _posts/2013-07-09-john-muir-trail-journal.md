I hiked about 165 miles on the John Muir Trail (JMT) from June 27-July 7, 2013 with 2 friends, Newton and Patrick (Team JMT). We we met up with friends Adam, Mason and Sandy (Team Charlotte Lake) at Charlotte Lake in Kings Canyon and hiked the last few days with them. This narrative is a fleshed out version of the trail notes I scrawled in my Rite-in-the-Rain journal each night of the trip. The handwriting, at least, is fixed here.

The John Muir Trail is a 211 mile trail from Yosemite Valley to the summit of Mt. Whitney, the tallest point in the lower 48. The JMT is one of the oldest long scenic hiking trails in America, and one of the most beautiful. It precedes the much longer and well known Appalachian Trail (AT) and Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) (which overlaps with most of the JMT). It traverses the crest of some of the highest and most remote mountains in the Sierra Nevada Range. The route of the modern JMT was first traversed in 1908 by a team of 3 people led by Joseph LeConte, in 28 days - a feat difficult to imagine without dynamited trails, Gore Tex and ultralight toothbrushes. Originally called the High Sierra Trail (now the name of a different trail), the trail was renamed when construction began in 1915 a year after the death of famed California naturalist John Muir. The final section of the trail, Forester Pass (the highest point on the PCT), was completed in 1932.

Due to limited vacation time and a fun plan to meet up with friends for the final few days, we ended up abridging the trail to start at Devil's Postpile Monument near Mammoth, CA to maximize our chances of success and avoid ending friendships over grueling 20-mile days.

## Day 0: Google to Tuolumne Meadows (208 miles)
Team JMT met up for dinner at Google Wednesday night, June 27, along with Sandy. After dinner, we finished repackaging our freeze dried meals in the parking lot (Mountain House packages weigh 0.6 ounces more than quart freezer Ziplocs - each!) and decided what food to leave behind with Sandy for our final resupply. We proceeded to test our stove, attempt putting up a tarp using trekking poles on the lawn, and tested our new Sawyer water filter in the Google pond. Of these three unusual tests, only the trekking pole tarp challenged the curiosity of the Google security guard. He was pleased that we were not, in fact planning on camping on the Google lawn.

We left Google campus at exactly 9:59 and arrived at Tuolumne Meadows Backpacker Campground at 2:15am. Given our plans to be at the ranger station when it opened at 8am, we were too lazy to set up our tarp, and suffered through the coldest night of the trip as a result.

## Day 1: Tuolumne Meadows to Devil's Postpile to Lake Virginia (58 miles, 17.5 miles)
We picked up our permits at the Tuolumne Meadows ranger station at 8am as planned, and after narrowly passing the Ranger's quiz on Leave No Trace Ethics, we set out to buy a new jacket for Patrick since his ultralight-no-longer-insulated synthetic sleeping bag didn't seem to be cutting it. We got distracted by Tuolumne Grill, where we each had a delicious breakfast sandwich before Patrick successfully acquired a fancy new Patagonia R1 Jacket. We hit the road a little after 9am, and drove to Mammoth. The road from Mammoth to Devil's Postpile is closed to cars during the day, and the first shuttle was full (they come every half hour), so we didn't end up leaving the trail until 11:37am.

After leaving the crowds at Devil's Postpile in the dust, we passed from the Ansel Adams Wilderness into the even more remote John Muir Wilderness, where we spent the next several days without seeing a single non-through hiker as far as I can remember. The predominant direction of PCT hikers is South to North (so they can get to the Sierras when the snow has melted there in June, but make it through the North Cascades before the snow starts in late September), whereas the JMT hikers prefer North to South (so you end, acclimatized, at the climactic summit of Mt. Whitney, instead of stumbling down into <del>Disney World</del> Yosemite Valley). This meant we met more PCT through hikers.

It is a truth universally acknowledged, we learned, that PCT hikers are crazy. You have to be pretty crazy to want to hike from Mexico to Canada, and if you survive 500 miles of Southern California desert, you come out even crazier than before. The hikers we met on our first day carried silver umbrellas (these are actually quite practical for sun protection, we learned, rather than quirky rain gear), antlers, tennis rackets (we still don't know where to find the nearest tennis court to the PCT) and boomboxes ("I brought John Lennon with me"). Many also wore colorful bandana gaiters around their feet, which we later learned are also practical, since they keep out dirt, pebbles and sticks from getting into your socks and shoes, which can increase blister risk.

About 5 miles in, we met a party of 3 fellow JMT hikers who were convinced that we were at a creek 5 miles further in than we were. We tried our best to convey our suspicion of our actual correct position, but they remained unpersuaded. I think they were in for a long afternoon. We later met a PCT hiker who tried to convince us that Purple Lake, a few miles before our intended destination, Lake Virginia, would be a nicer campsite (false). She claimed that the terrain after Purple Lake was down and then up, making a nice warmup for the next day (also false - the two lakes are separated by a hill). We spent the afternoon leapfrogging Ragin' Cajun and Pins, a young man and woman (possibly a couple - unclear), who met a few weeks earlier on the PCT and decided to hitchhike to Mammoth and do the Sierras North to South before continuing.

Exhausted from sleep deprivation, driving, and hiking, we stumbled into our campsite at Lake Virginia at 8:08pm, just in time for a beautiful sunset and stargazing over my favorite campsite of the whole trip.

## Day 2: Lake Virginia to Bear Creek (19 miles)
After a very long first 36 hours, we let ourselves sleep in until around 8am to start Day 2.
