*"Some gays are actually having children born to them. It's not right on paper. It's not right in fact. Every child has a right to a mother and father."* -[Mitt Romney, 2005](http://bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2012/10/24/mitt-romney-overruled-state-agency-and-rejected-new-birth-certificates-for-children-born-gay-parents/TqOHBb99V98H6nGQqUQrjO/story.html)

In most elections, Republicans vs. Democrats is like a good sports rivalry - most of us would rather be caught dead than root for our team's opponent, but we can all agree to disagree. This election is more personal, though, for some of us. If you are a supporter of Mitt Romney, I would ask you to spare a few minutes to read this blog post in its entirety; I assume that you probably aren't aware of just how bad Mitt Romney is on LGBT rights, and how important that is to your queer friends and family.

If you agree that equality for all people is important, help spread the word about what this election means to you and your friends and family. Please share this post on your favorite social network and show your outrage at the idea that an anti-gay politician could be elected President of the United States in 2012. You should be just as outraged as you would be if Strom Thurmond won the Republican nomination.

## Just the facts
* Romney [opposes civil unions for gay people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/09/mitt-romney-gay-marriage-civil-unions-obama_n_1503597.html) (giving gay couples many of the legal rights of marriage without the name). This puts him to the right of Sarah Palin, George W. Bush, and Dick Cheney.
* Romney believes that [hospital visitation rights are a "privilege" not a right](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jamie-mcgonnigal/romney-may-end-hospital-visitation-rights-for-many-gay-couples_b_1996964.html) and should be left to the states to decide.
* Romney [aggressively fought to deny gay marriage](http://www.hrc.org/the-truth-about-mitt-romney/on-the-issues#.UJbZ34ye-f9) while Governor of Massachusetts and fought to cut funding to LGBT youth programs and domestic abuse related services.
* I can be [fired in 29 states simply for being gay](http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/federal-legislation/employment-non-discrimination-act). Romney [opposes federal legislation to stop that](http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/obama-v.-romney-on-enda/).
* *"I didn't know you had families."* While leading a failed campaign to amend the Massachusetts campaign to ban gay marriage in 2004, Romney demonstrated a [total lack of awareness and empathy](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michelangelo-signorile/romney-some-gays-are-actu_b_2022314.html) for the lives of gay people, telling one woman "I don't really care what you tell your adopted daughter." The woman's child wasn't even adopted.
* As an 18-year old, Romney [led a group of boys to bully a fellow gay student and cut off his hair](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-prep-school-classmates-recall-pranks-but-also-troubling-incidents/2012/05/10/gIQA3WOKFU_story.html).
* 9 out of 10 gay teenagers report being [physically or verbally harassed](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/04/us/04suicide.html?_r=0). Gay teenagers are 5 times more likely to be suicidal than straight teenagers. Suicide rates are [higher in conservative areas](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/18/gay-teen-suicides-and-str_n_850345.html) that are less supportive of gay rights.
* Depression and drug use in LGBT populations [increase after passing discriminatory laws](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2009.168815).

## This is personal for me
I don't expect you to vote for Barack Obama, but I hope that you'd seriously consider taking a stand for equality and voting for a candidate who is more closely aligned with your views. Voting for [Gary Johnson](http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/about), the Libertarian Party candidate and former Governor of New Mexico, would send a message to the Republican party that inequality and discrimination are never OK. I can agree to disagree respectfully with Gary Johnson's views because he doesn't use me as a punch line or try to restrict my freedom to pursue happiness. We can't let a man who regularly takes degrading potshots at minorities and poor people lead the most powerful nation on Earth.

When you go to the ballot box, imagine looking me in the eye and telling me that your macroeconomic hypothesis is more important than my right to visit my spouse on his deathbed someday. Imagine telling an at-risk gay teenager on the way to the ballot box that she don't deserve the same future as her straight classmates. Imagine that Romney was talking about *your* family and saying it wasn't right. Pullitzer prize winner Doug Wright [phrased it better than I can](http://www.salon.com/2012/10/26/my_taxes_mean_more_than_your_fundamental_civil_rights/):

*"It's like voting for George Wallace during the Civil Rights movements, and apologizing for his racism. You’re still complicit. You’re still perpetuating anti-gay legislation and cultural homophobia. You don’t get to walk away clean, because you say you 'disagree' with your candidate on these issues."*

While Mitt Romney probably can't prevent my inevitable equality, he can still have an impact on millions of gay Americans growing up right now in an intolerant country, raising families, and trying to live ordinary lives with dignity. How can you trust someone who smiles and says that your friends and family are freaks and second class citizens?

Nothing is more important to America than equality and freedom. No amount of wealth is worth sacrificing liberty and justice. When you fill out your ballot on Tuesday, I hope you vote for a candidate who believes in one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

*"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."*
