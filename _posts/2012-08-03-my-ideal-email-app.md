A lot of people complain loudly about disliking email. I'm one of those people. Email is overloaded - it's a personal communication app, a to-do list, a central notification center, and a coupon/brochure repository. Unfortunately, it's bad at all of those things. It's easy for me to opt out of everything but the first one - I use [Clear](/clear-checklist-app-just-raised-the-bar-for-mobile-design) for my to-do lists, iPhone Notification Center for notifications, and I opt-out of the whole coupon/brochure thing ([SaneBox](http://www.sanebox.com/) helps). For a personal communication center, I have long preferred Twitter DM (until it stopped working) and Facebook Messages. The only problem is I can't force all of my friends to use these.

For a while, I have been daydreaming about my ideal email application. Let's call it MEC, Modern Email Client. It would be an iPhone app, since I mainly use my phone for communication. It would strip away all the bullshit involved in email - no reply/reply all/forward, just a single threaded conversation that you could leave or add people to. If you want to reply to an individual, you tap their avatar (since of course a modern email app would scrape your Facebook friends for this) and it goes to your ongoing communication thread with that friend. How many times have you seen a humiliating Reply All Fail? Now multiply that by at least 100 and you have a decent estimate of the total number of Reply All Fails, most of which are harmless. MEC gets rid of Reply All Fail, because you know what conversation you're in. People complain about Facebook having confusing privacy settings ([they do](/facebook-changed-my-default-privacy-setting)) but the fact of the matter is it's way easier to screw up privacy in a simple email conversation.

Push notifications are pretty important to MEC. I don't use push notifications for email since most emails aren't urgent and I don't want my pocket to turn into a vibrator. I would like notifications, however, when someone I'm actually friends with emails me. So by default push notifications would be on for my Facebook friends, but I could toggle them on and off from the app for each friend. If I send a new message, there should be a switch (on by default) to send me a push notification for responses. If I'm on a thread that isn't relevant right now, but I don't want to leave (example: an ongoing thread with my rock climbing friends, but I have other plans tonight), I can turn off notifications until 8am tomorrow.

Some other key features in MEC: links would automatically have previews with title/description/thumbnail added. It would be easy to quickly take a picture from your phone to add to the conversation.

This morning, as I was getting ready to leave for work, I pulled out my phone and quickly scanned an email conversation with friends planning a trip to Tahoe for the weekend. There were 3 messages, and the first had a question, to which I answered "Yes to all of those." First, however, I had to discard the initial email, since it was written in Reply mode instead of Reply All (and the default iPhone mail app doesn't let you switch). Then, when I read the conversation on my computer in GMail an hour later, I realized the reply was out of context for GMail users since it would appear after the other messages. WTF? How do we still have a communication system in 2012 where everyone sees different things, and the user a 5% chance of accidentally either failing to send the message to all relevant parties, or humiliating themselves by accidentally making a private message public?

And then I realized I already have MEC installed on my phone. It's called Messenger. It's made by Facebook. It has most of the features I described above. And I don't have to force my friends to use it, since one of the much maligned and forgotten features of Facebook (to which they embarrassingly [tried to force people to switch to](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/06/facebook-forces-all-users-over-to-facebook-com-e-mail-addresses/)) is that your username@facebook.com routes email messages to Facebook Messages. It even knows my friends email addresses, since they're on Facebook, and automatically adds their avatars. It's not perfect - there are already a few glitches. For example, if someone sends me an email from an address they don't have registered on Facebook, it goes to the black hole "Other" folder and doesn't show their avatar (you'd think a quick comparison to names of my friends would work here). After trying this experiment for a week, I'll write a follow-up post. Stay tuned.

I set up an auto-responder for GMail and intend to use it the way I've been using Hotmail (a black hole for using with commercial services). What do you think? What are your objections? Have I finally gone off the deep end? Am I the first human in recorded history to *intentionally* switch their primary email to @facebook.com? Comment below...
