Tweetbot is a great iPhone Twitter app for power users. Here are 6 reasons why you should switch to Tweetbot if you haven't already.

## 1. You use lists

Lists are buried in the official Twitter app. You need to click on your profile, then lists, then the list you want. Every time you use the app. In Tweetbot, you simply tap the navigation title on the main Timeline tab and a menu pops up with your lists. The app remembers which list you want when you return to this tab. I follow 480 people, but have a private list called "People that Matter" with only 85 people that I try to follow more closely. I generally read this list; when I'm bored I'll switch to Timeline for the fire hose.

## 2. You use direct messages
DM is pretty much my preferred form of communication. Sadly, Twitter seems to be deprecating this feature - to access your DMs from the official app, you need to perform some sort of arcane gesture or incantation to read your DMs. Solution: use Tweetbot, where DMs are still a primary tab.

## 3. You're tired of reading Tweets from some conference you're not attending

Mute Filters is really useful during #sxsw. Or when <a href='http://twitter.com/ericries'>@ericries</a> is at a conference and tweeting every 5 seconds. This feature speaks for itself and should have been built into Twitter a long time ago.

## 4. You don't use the same 5 features I do

Tweetbot has custom tabs. Not sure if this is original to Tweetbot, but it's the first time I've seen the feature. Tap and hold on the last two tabs to bring up a menu with other tabs. This allows you to quickly access all possible tabs, but save your favorites for instant access. For me, mute filters and search; but maybe you'd prefer your profile and favorites? Doesn't matter with Tweetbot. The user has control over their own UX.

## 5. You want to quickly see if someone is following you

I'm not sure if there's an easy way to do this from the official app. If there is, I haven't found it. In Tweetbot, simply open a profile and it displays at the top whether or not the user is following you. Sadly, the Biebs is still not following me. Sigh.

## 6. You want to read a webpage that is not optimized for mobile

Somehow most of the web still is not optimized for mobile. Pages are unreadable and/or take forever to load. Tweetbot has the service Readability built in and lets you quickly swap back and forth between standard mode and Readability, where you see only nicely formatted text and images and have custom control over the reading experience.
