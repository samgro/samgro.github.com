Boy do I love the Clear app. I've been using it everyday to keep track of my todos and groceries. As I mentioned in <a href='/clear-checklist-app-just-raised-the-bar-for-mobile-design/'>my last post about Clear</a>, there are a few issues I'd like to see fixed in the next version. After a week of heavy use, here are the biggest issues, in order of severity:

<ul class='long'>
  <li> I am constantly tapping on the text in the middle level, which opens edit view instead of tapping to drill down. I rarely change the name of a list; this view should be optimized for drilling down, not editing. I should have to double tap to edit here. A single tap anywhere on the item should drill down.</li>
  <li>I often try to go up a level with a long swipe but don't swipe hard enough and end up creating a new item. At the very least, I should be able to long swipe up from here to go up a level and escape the new item view.</li>
  <li>Occasionally I delete something unintentionally or otherwise screw up - would love to shake to undo.</li>
  <li>Often when I swipe left or right, it picks up the inevitable vertical motion and does nothing.</li>
  <li>There's no good way to add items quickly to the bottom of the list in descending order (i.e. each new item is the last item in the list). Tapping the black space under the item should add a new item below, not close the keyboard. If I want to close the keyboard, I'll just hit done.</li>
</ul>
I kind of hope Apple shamelessly steals the Clear interface and integrates it with the iOS SDK.
